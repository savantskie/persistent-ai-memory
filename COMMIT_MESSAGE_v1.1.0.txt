COMMIT MESSAGE FOR v1.1.0 RELEASE

Release v1.1.0: Path independence, configuration system, and comprehensive documentation reorganization

## Summary

v1.1.0 marks a major architectural improvement to persistent-ai-memory, introducing universal path independence and a professional configuration system. The system now works seamlessly on any deployment (standalone, OpenWebUI, Docker) with zero hardcoded paths. Complete documentation has been reorganized into five specialized guides for better usability.

## Major Changes

### 🔧 Path Independence (BREAKING CHANGE in structure, COMPATIBLE in function)
- **Removed all hardcoded paths** from core modules (short_term_memory.py, database_maintenance.py, etc.)
- **Environment variable driven configuration**: AI_MEMORY_DATA_DIR, AI_MEMORY_LOG_DIR, AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_URL, AI_MEMORY_LLM_URL
- **Smart path resolution**: Uses environment variables → JSON config files → sensible defaults
- **Cross-platform support**: Windows, Linux, macOS with proper path handling
- **Docker compatible**: Automatic path synchronization to /app/data paths in containers
- **Backward compatible**: Existing deployments continue to work with ~/.ai_memory/ defaults

### ⚙️ Configuration System (NEW)
- **memory_config.json** - New file providing valve defaults for standalone/non-OpenWebUI deployments
  - LLM provider configuration (type, endpoint, model, API key)
  - Embedding configuration (provider endpoints)
  - Relevance thresholds and memory management settings
  - Memory bank configuration and display preferences
- **embedding_config.json** - Enhanced with multi-provider fallback support
  - Primary + fallback providers for high availability
  - Support for Ollama, LM Studio, OpenAI
  - Configurable timeouts, retries, batch processing
- **Configuration priority hierarchy**: Environment variables > JSON files > hardcoded defaults
- **Helper functions** in short_term_memory.py for smart config loading

### 🏷️ Tag Management System
- **tag_manager.py** ported from Friday project
- Automatic tag extraction, normalization, and canonicalization
- Integrated with database_maintenance.py for registry synchronization
- Supports local and Docker path registries

### ✅ Health Check Improvements
- **test_health_check.py** now fully functional (previously empty)
- Validates all imports, configs, databases, and provider connectivity
- Colored output for clear pass/fail visibility
- Specific error messages with actionable solutions
- Windows and Linux-specific diagnostic messages

### 📚 Documentation Reorganization
**README.md reduced from 1,183 lines to ~350 lines**, now serves as navigation hub with links to:
- **CONFIGURATION.md** (NEW) - Complete configuration reference including environment variables, JSON file formats, multi-provider setup, Docker deployment, performance tuning
- **TESTING.md** (NEW) - Health check guide, test suite documentation, performance validation, CI/CD examples
- **API.md** (NEW) - Complete API reference with method signatures, parameters, return types, examples for all core operations
- **DEPLOYMENT.md** (NEW) - Production setup, Docker Compose, scaling, monitoring, maintenance procedures, capacity planning
- **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** (NEW) - 10+ common issues with solutions, diagnostic procedures, advanced troubleshooting
- **COMMUNITY.md** - Updated with v1.1.0 references and new doc links
- **CONTRIBUTORS.md** - Updated with v1.1.0 phase credits
- **GITHUB_GUIDE.md** - Updated with v1.1.0 release information

### 🐳 Docker Enhancements
- Database registries automatically sync to both local and /app/data/ paths
- Graceful fallback if Docker paths unavailable
- Environment variables for containerized deployments
- Full docker-compose.yml example in DEPLOYMENT.md

### ✨ Other Improvements
- Comprehensive GitHub issue resolutions documented in INSTALL.md
- Windows-specific path and environment variable guidance
- Database troubleshooting with lock file resolution
- Provider connectivity validation in health check
- Cross-platform path resolution using pathlib

(Archived versions saved to /media/nate/Friday/Friday/Decisions_Folder/ARCHIVE for historical reference)

## Configuration Migration

### No Breaking Changes for Users
- Existing ~/.ai_memory/ directory structure is preserved
- Existing databases remain compatible
- Default behavior unchanged if no configuration provided

### For New Deployments
Recommended setup:
```bash
# Set environment variables
export AI_MEMORY_DATA_DIR="$HOME/.ai_memory"
export AI_MEMORY_LOG_DIR="$HOME/.ai_memory/logs"

# Create embedding_config.json (template created during install)
# Create memory_config.json (optional, uses defaults if missing)

# Validate
python tests/test_health_check.py
```

## Testing Recommendations

Before releasing, verify:
1. `python tests/test_health_check.py` on Windows, Linux, macOS
2. Standalone memory operations work with different data directories
3. Configuration loading from memory_config.json
4. Docker path synchronization (if Docker available)
5. All 4 embedding provider types can be configured

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible**
- Existing ~/.ai_memory/ structure unchanged
- Database schemas unchanged
- API signatures unchanged
- Only internal path handling improved

Users upgrading from v1.0.0 → v1.1.0:
- No migration needed
- No configuration changes required to continue working
- Optional: Create memory_config.json or embedding_config.json for explicit configuration

## Version Information

- **Previous**: v1.0.0 (February 21, 2026)
- **Current**: v1.1.0 (February 23, 2026)
- **Python**: 3.8+ (no change)
- **Dependencies**: No new dependencies added
