## ü§ù Getting Help

### Quick Help Checklist
Before opening an issue, please try these steps:

1. **Run the health check**:
   ```bash
   python tests/test_health_check.py
   ```

2. **Check your Python version**:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   (Needs to be 3.8 or higher)

3. **Verify installation**:
   ```bash
   python -c "from ai_memory_core import PersistentAIMemorySystem; print('‚úÖ Import successful')"
   ```

### üÜò Common Issues & Solutions

#### Installation Issues

**‚ùå "python is not recognized"**
- **Solution**: Install Python from [python.org](https://python.org) and add it to your PATH

**‚ùå "No module named 'ai_memory_core'"**
- **Solution**: Make sure you ran `pip install -e .` in the project directory

**‚ùå "Permission denied"**
- **Windows**: Run Command Prompt as Administrator
- **Mac/Linux**: Use `sudo` or check your user permissions

**‚ùå "git not found"**
- **Solution**: Install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)

#### Runtime Issues

**‚ùå "Database locked" errors**
- **Solution**: Close any other instances of the memory system
- **Or**: Restart and try again (SQLite locks usually clear quickly)

**‚ùå "Connection refused" when using embeddings**
- **Solution**: Make sure LM Studio is running on http://localhost:1234
- **Or**: Update the embedding service URL in your config

**‚ùå Memory searches return no results**
- **Check**: Are you storing memories first? Try the basic example
- **Check**: Is LM Studio generating embeddings? Look for embedding vectors in database

## üêõ Reporting Issues

### Before You Report
1. Run the health check and include the output
2. Try the basic example to see if core functionality works
3. Search existing issues to see if someone else reported it
