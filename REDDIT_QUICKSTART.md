# Quick Start for Reddit Users üëã

Welcome! Someone shared this on Reddit and you want to try it? Here's the fastest way to get started.

## üéØ What This Does

This gives your AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) a **persistent memory** that:
- Remembers conversations across sessions
- Learns from your interactions
- Provides semantic search through your chat history
- Works with multiple AI platforms

## ‚ö° Super Quick Setup (Choose One)

### If you're on Windows:
```cmd
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/savantskie/persistent-ai-memory/main/install.bat -o install.bat && install.bat
```

### If you're on Mac/Linux:
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/savantskie/persistent-ai-memory/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Don't have curl? Manual way:
1. Download the code: [Click here](https://github.com/savantskie/persistent-ai-memory/archive/main.zip)
2. Extract the zip file
3. Open terminal/command prompt in that folder
4. Run: `pip install -e .`

## üß™ Test It Works

After installation, run this:
```bash
python tests/test_health_check.py
```

You should see "‚úÖ System health check passed!"

## üéÆ Try It Out

Create a file called `test_memory.py`:

```python
import asyncio
from ai_memory_core import PersistentAIMemorySystem

async def demo():
    memory = PersistentAIMemorySystem()
    
    # Store some memories
    await memory.create_memory("I love Python programming", memory_type="personal", importance_level=7)
    await memory.create_memory("I'm learning about AI memory systems", memory_type="study", importance_level=5)
    await memory.create_memory("Reddit has great tech communities", memory_type="social", importance_level=3)
    
    # Search memories (with filters)
    search_output = await memory.search_memories(
        query="programming",
        memory_type="personal",
        min_importance=3,
        max_importance=10
    )
    memories = search_output.get("results", [])
    print(f"Found {len(memories)} personal memories about programming with importance 3-10:")
    for mem in memories:
        if isinstance(mem, dict):
            mem_type = mem.get("type", "unknown")
            data = mem.get("data", mem)
            content = data.get("content", str(data))
            importance = data.get("importance_level", "N/A")
            print(f"- [{mem_type}] {content} (importance: {importance})")
        else:
            print(f"- [unknown] {mem}")

# Run the demo
asyncio.run(demo())
```

Run it: `python test_memory.py`
---
**Troubleshooting:**
If you only see one result, try removing filters (like `memory_type` or `importance_level`) or check your stored memory contents. The search uses semantic similarity and filters, so results may vary based on your query and filters.

## ü§ñ Use with Your AI Assistant

### For Claude Desktop:
Add this to your Claude Desktop config to give Claude access to the memory system.

### For ChatGPT:
The system can monitor your ChatGPT export files automatically.

### For LM Studio:
Works out of the box if you have LM Studio running locally.

## üÜò Something Broke?

1. **Python not found?** Install Python 3.8+ from python.org
2. **Permission errors?** Try running as administrator (Windows) or with `sudo` (Mac/Linux)
3. **Still stuck?** Open an issue on GitHub with your error message

## üí¨ Questions?

- Check the [full README](README.md) for detailed docs
- Look at [examples](examples/) for more use cases
- Open a GitHub issue if you're stuck

## üåü Like It?

If this helps you, star the repo! ‚≠ê

It helps other people find the project.
